              <h2>My Journey & Bio</h2>
              <p>
                As a passionate Frontend Engineer, my journey in technology has been driven by 
                curiosity and a relentless pursuit of creating meaningful digital experiences. 
                I believe that great software isn't just about code—it's about solving real problems 
                and creating intuitive interfaces that users love.
              </p>
              <p>
                My approach to development combines technical expertise with user-centered design 
                principles. I thrive on transforming complex requirements into clean, maintainable 
                code that not only functions flawlessly but also delivers exceptional user experiences.
              </p>
              <p>
                Beyond coding, I'm constantly learning and adapting to new technologies and 
                methodologies. The ever-evolving nature of frontend development excites me, and 
                I'm committed to staying at the forefront of industry trends and best practices.

            <!-- Goals Section -->
            <section class="about-section" data-testid="test-about-goals">
              <h2>Goals in This Program</h2>
              <p>
                My primary goal in this program is to deepen my understanding of modern web 
                development practices and enhance my problem-solving skills through hands-on, 
                real-world projects. I'm particularly excited about:
              </p>
              
              <h3>Technical Mastery</h3>
              <p>
                Strengthening my expertise in React ecosystem, TypeScript, and advanced CSS 
                techniques. I aim to master performance optimization and build more accessible, 
                scalable applications.
              </p>
              
              <h3>Collaborative Development</h3>
              <p>
                Working within a team environment to understand industry-standard workflows, 
                version control best practices, and effective communication in technical teams.
              </p>
              
              <h3>Full-Stack Exposure</h3>
              <p>
                While my focus remains on frontend, I want to gain practical understanding of 
                backend technologies to become a more well-rounded developer who can contribute 
                to discussions across the entire stack.

            <section class="about-section" data-testid="test-about-confidence">
              <h2>Areas I'm Working To Strengthen</h2>
              <p>
                Being honest about areas for growth is crucial for development. Here are some 
                aspects I'm actively working to improve:
              </p>
              
              <h3>Advanced State Management</h3>
              <p>
                While comfortable with basic state management patterns, I want to deepen my 
                understanding of complex state architectures and when to use different solutions 
                beyond React's built-in state management.
              </p>
              
              <h3>Performance Optimization at Scale</h3>
              <p>
                Understanding performance bottlenecks in large-scale applications and mastering 
                advanced optimization techniques beyond the basics.
              </p>
              
              <h3>Testing Strategies</h3>
              <p>
                Developing more comprehensive testing strategies that go beyond unit tests to 
                include integration and end-to-end testing in complex applications.
              </p>
              
              <h3>System Design Thinking</h3>
              <p>
                Improving my ability to architect larger systems from the ground up, considering 
                scalability, maintainability, and team collaboration from the initial design phase.

            <section class="about-section" data-testid="test-about-future-note">
              <h2>Note to My Future Self</h2>
              <p>
                Dear Future William,
              </p>
              <p>
                Remember why you started this journey—it was never just about writing code, 
                but about creating impact through technology. Stay curious and never stop learning. 
                The technologies will change, but the fundamental problem-solving skills and 
                passion for creating great user experiences will always be valuable.
              </p>
              <p>
                Don't be afraid to take on challenging projects that push you beyond your comfort 
                zone. That's where the real growth happens. Remember that every expert was once 
                a beginner, and every complex system was built one line of code at a time.
              </p>
              <p>
                Stay humble, collaborate generously, and always make time to help others in 
                their journey. The tech community thrives when we lift each other up.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most importantly, maintain balance. Great code comes from a rested mind and 
                a passionate heart.
              </p>
              <p>

            <!-- Extra Thoughts Section -->
            <section class="about-section" data-testid="test-about-extra">
              <h2>Additional Reflections</h2>
              
              <h3>On the Evolution of Frontend Development</h3>
              <p>
                The frontend landscape has evolved dramatically, and it's fascinating to see 
                how our role as frontend developers has expanded. We're no longer just 
                implementing designs—we're architects of user experience, performance 
                optimizers, and accessibility advocates.
              </p>
              
              <h3>The Importance of Soft Skills</h3>
              <p>
                Technical skills get you in the door, but soft skills build your career. 
                Communication, empathy, and the ability to explain complex technical concepts 
                to non-technical stakeholders are becoming increasingly valuable in our field.
              </p>
              
              <h3>Continuous Learning Mindset</h3>
              <p>
                In technology, standing still means falling behind. I've learned to embrace 
                the constant learning curve as an opportunity rather than a burden. Each new 
                framework, tool, or methodology is a chance to solve problems more effectively.
              </p>
              
              <h3>Building for Humans</h3>
              <p>
                At the end of the day, we're building for people. Whether it's a simple 
                landing page or a complex web application, the human experience should always 
                be at the center of our technical decisions.
              </p>
              
              <h3>Final Thought</h3>
              <p>
                This journey in tech is a marathon, not a sprint. It's about consistent growth, 
                resilience in the face of challenges, and the joy of creating something that 
                didn't exist before. I'm excited to see where this path leads and the impact 
                we can create together.
